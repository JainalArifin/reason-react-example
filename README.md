# ReasonReact Template & Examples

This is:
- A template for your new ReasonReact project.
- A collection of thin examples illustrating ReasonReact usage.
- Extra helper documentation for ReasonReact (full ReasonReact docs [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)).

`src` contains 4 sub-folders, each an independent ReasonReact example. Feel free to delete any of them and shape this into your project!

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload.
